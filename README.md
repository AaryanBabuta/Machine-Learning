# Machine-Learning Repository
## Overview
This repository contains code, datasets, and documentation for various machine learning projects and experiments. It includes implementations of supervised learning models, along with data preprocessing, model training and evaluation.

## Structure
* `/datasets`: Contains datasets used for model training and evaluation.
* `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for detailed experiments and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  
## Key Features
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, Transforming, and Scaling data.

**Model Training:** Implementation of algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, SVMs and more.

**Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

**Visualization:** Plotting data insights, learning curves, and model performance.

## Usage
Explore the datasets and preprocessing steps in `/datasets` and `/notebooks`.
